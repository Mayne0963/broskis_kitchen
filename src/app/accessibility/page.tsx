      <p>At Broskis Kitchen, we build legacies—and we build them for everyone. Our digital spaces follow the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that no soul is left behind in the order of Earth. We constantly test our sites and apps with real-deal assistive tech (screen readers, switch devices, voice control, etc.) and real users who know that hustle.

If you or someone you ride with has trouble navigating our online menus, placing an order, or engaging with any Broskis Kitchen channel, holler at us at accessibility@broskiskitchen.com. In your message, drop:

Your contact info
The web address or screen where you hit a roadblock
A quick note on what assistive gear or tech you were using
Note: This inbox is strictly for accessibility issues. For any other feedback—flames, props, or general inquiries—slide over to our main Customer Service page, and our crew will get back to you.

Inclusive Ordering, Broskis Style
We’re on a mission to feed body and soul—no exceptions. Whether you roll up on the Broskis Kitchen app, tap in on our website, lock in your order at the counter, or drive up for that soul-food pickup, we’ve optimized every lane:

Accessible App & Site: Screen-reader friendly, full keyboard navigation, and high-contrast mode so menus pop for every eye.
Kiosk-Free Counter: No touchscreens? No problem. Hit the counter, and our crew’s got your back.
Drive-Thru Support: Speech or hearing disability? Pull up, drop your order, and we’ll handle the rest.
Alternate Menu Formats:
Large-print menus you can grab in-store
Picture-based guides for quick visual picks
Audio menu option through our app’s “Listen Mode”
Heads-up: We capture video at our pick-up windows and cooking lines for service-level insights, tech R&D, and safety. Dive into our Recording Notice FAQ on the site for details.

At Broskis Kitchen, our creed is clear: build systems that uplift every member of the tribe. If you hit any snags, we’re here to decode and elevate.</p>
