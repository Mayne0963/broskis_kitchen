              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Broski's Kitchen was born from a simple vision: to elevate street food to luxury dining standards. 
                What started as a single food truck in Los Angeles has grown into a culinary movement that celebrates 
                the intersection of street culture and gourmet cuisine.

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Our founder's passion for authentic flavors and premium ingredients led to the creation of our 
                signature Boosie Wings and other innovative dishes that have earned critical acclaim and a devoted following.
