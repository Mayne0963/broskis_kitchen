# Firebase Client Configuration Fix

## Problem
The website was showing a black screen because Firebase client initialization was failing due to missing environment variables. The client-side Firebase configuration was looking for server-side environment variables that aren't available in the browser.

## Root Cause
- Firebase client configuration was using `process.env.FIREBASE_*` variables
- These variables are only available on the server-side
- Client-side code needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefixed variables to access them in the browser

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Firebase Client Configuration
- Modified `/src/lib/firebase/client.ts` to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables first
- Added fallback to regular `FIREBASE_*` variables for backward compatibility
- Added proper validation to check if Firebase configuration is complete

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Firebase client now fails gracefully when environment variables are missing
- Clear console warnings show exactly which variables are missing
- App continues to function without Firebase features when configuration is incomplete

### 3. Environment Variables Needed in Vercel

Add these **NEXT_PUBLIC** prefixed variables to Vercel for client-side access:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=broskis-kitchen-44d2d.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=broskis-kitchen-44d2d
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=broskis-kitchen-44d2d.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=885632684914
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:885632684914:web:d6e94734810ec531b983eb
```

## Expected Result
- Website loads properly without black screen
- Firebase features work when environment variables are properly configured
- Clear error messages when Firebase configuration is incomplete
- App remains functional even without Firebase
