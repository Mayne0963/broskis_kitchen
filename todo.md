# Error Analysis and Fixes Todo

## Phase 2: Analyze specific errors from screenshots

### Errors identified from Screenshot 1 (Vercel deployment log):
- [x] TypeScript compilation errors - Related to missing env vars
- [x] Missing dependencies or type definitions - Dependencies installed successfully
- [x] Build process failures - Due to environment validation failure
- [x] Environment variable issues - MAIN ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### Errors identified from Screenshot 2 (Terminal output):
- [x] File deletion operations - Normal cleanup operations
- [x] TypeScript/React build processes - Working after npm install
- [x] Potential dependency installation issues - Resolved

### Root Cause Analysis:
**PRIMARY ISSUE: Missing Environment Variables**
The build fails during the validate-env step because the following required environment variables are missing:
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL  
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- FIREBASE_API_KEY
- FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
- FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
- FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- FIREBASE_APP_ID
- RECAPTCHA_V3_SITE_KEY
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- ADMIN_EMAILS

## Phase 3: Identify and fix root causes
- [x] Fix TypeScript configuration issues - No issues found, works with proper env vars
- [x] Resolve missing dependencies - Dependencies installed successfully  
- [x] Fix environment variable setup - All required env vars configured
- [x] Resolve build configuration problems - Build progresses successfully

## Phase 4: Test fixes
- [x] Run local build test - Build progresses much further
- [x] Verify TypeScript compilation - Compilation successful
- [x] Test deployment process - Environment validation passes

## Phase 5: Report findings
- [x] Document all fixes applied - Comprehensive report created
- [x] Provide recommendations for future deployments - Included in report

### SUMMARY OF FIXES APPLIED:
✅ **MAIN ISSUE RESOLVED:** Added all missing environment variables
✅ **DEPENDENCIES:** Successfully installed all npm packages  
✅ **TYPESCRIPT:** Compilation now works properly
✅ **BUILD PROCESS:** Progresses successfully until Firebase parsing

⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUE:** Firebase service account JSON parsing needs refinement
