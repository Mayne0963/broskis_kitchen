## Tasks
- Check working tree status and current branch.
- Stage only code/test changes (exclude `.trae/documents` unless you want them pushed).
- Commit with a clear message summarizing fixes.
- Push to `origin` on `main`.

## Notes
- If the branch is not `main`, push to the current branch and report the remote.
- If there are no changes, report clean status and do nothing.

## Confirmation
- I will proceed to run the above steps and push. Do you want me to include `.trae/documents` in the commit?
