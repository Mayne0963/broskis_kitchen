## 3. Core Process

### Customer Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Access**: User visits protected route (dashboard, profile, orders)
2. **Authentication Check**: System verifies session cookie and user authentication status
3. **Loading State**: Display authentication verification loading indicator
4. **Verification Complete**: 
   - If authenticated: Render requested protected content
   - If not authenticated: Redirect to login page with return URL
5. **Login Process**: User enters credentials or uses Google OAuth
6. **Session Creation**: System creates secure session cookie and updates authentication state
7. **Redirect to Destination**: User is redirected to originally requested page
8. **Protected Content Access**: User can now access all protected features seamlessly

### Admin Authentication Flow

1. **Admin Login**: Enhanced security verification with additional checks
2. **Role Verification**: System validates admin permissions and access levels
3. **Security Monitoring**: All admin actions are logged and monitored
4. **Session Management**: Admin sessions have shorter timeout periods for security

### Session Refresh Flow

1. **Background Monitoring**: System monitors session expiration in background
2. **Automatic Refresh**: Sessions are refreshed automatically before expiration
3. **User Notification**: Users are notified of session status changes
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If refresh fails, user is guided through re-authentication
