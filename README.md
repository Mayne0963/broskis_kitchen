# Broskis Kitchen

This repository contains the source for the Broski's Kitchen website. To run the project locally, install dependencies and create an `.env.local` file with any required API keys.

Use `npm run lint` to check code style and `npm run build` to create a production build.

Missing Firebase or Stripe environment variables are gracefully handled so the site can still build without them.
